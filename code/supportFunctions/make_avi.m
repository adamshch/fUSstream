function make_avi(Fmov, video_name, varargin)

% make_avi(video_name, Fmov, contrast_val)
%
% Function to write the movie Fmov to an avi movie file. The inputs to this
% function are:
%   - Fmov         - 3D array of data to save (mov(:,:,kk) is the kk^th
%                    frame of the movie)
%   - video_name   - String containing the file-name to save the data as
%   - contrast_val - OPTIONAL input that indicates the contrast with which
%                    to plot each frame
