% function write_movie(mov,save_name,{dataType,dataHeader,blockSize})
%
% Write the 3-D array in mov to a file. Can writ to either a tiff stack, a
% fits file, or a matlab '.mat' file. The mode is automatically chosen
% based on the extension of the file-name passed to the function
% (save_name). The inputs to this function are
%     - mov       - 3D array of data to save (mov(:,:,kk) is the kk^th
%                   frame of the movie)
%     - save_name - String containing the file-name to save the data as
