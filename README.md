# fUSstream
Repository containing code and misc files for neuroscience-oriented functional ultrasound imaging.

code - This main folder contains the core code for processing fUS data. Please see documentation for details.

3Dprinting - This folder contains the 3D printing files needed to create the custom parts required for the surgery. 

This code is designed to work with MATLAB 2018b and later, and has been tested on versions 2018b, 2020a, 2020b, 2021a, 2021b in both linux and windows environments. 

Parallelization greatly speeds up the software. Running the demo script with 16 cores on a multi-core workstation desktop should take under one hour.
